# Tkinter Issue - When Windows has scaling enabled (Settings->Display->Scale and layout set to anything other 100%), 
# tkinter may redraw the application at the wrong resolution. 
# For example, if the scale is set to 150% and the tkinter application draws an image on a canvas, the application
# will rescale at 100%.

# For a good description, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44398075/can-dpi-scaling-be-enabled-disabled-programmatically-on-a-per-session-basis

# Import ctypes to get and set the dpi 
import ctypes

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dpi_awareness = ctypes.windll.shcore.SetProcessDpiAwareness(2)
    main()
